### Abstract

### Introduction

-   Setup: which scale?

    -   Broadest: global biodiversity loss (as in Knapp et al. 2024)

    -   Middle: global amphibian declines (as in Keung et al. 2019)

    -   Narrowest: SNYLF are an endangered species... (as in Pope and Matthews 2004)

-   Contextualize:

    -   reintroduction as a conservation method (as in Keung et al. 2019)

    -   Reintroductions of Bd resistant Rana sierrae have proved to be a successful method for recovery in the Yosemite National park (Knapp et al. 2024).

-   Bridge:

    -   Reintroductions rely on donations from naturally persistent populations with evolved resistance to Bd

    -   It is vital to understand what drives the population dynamics of these persistent donor populations to inform conservation efforts

    -   Large, persistent populations in the northern part of the species' range are relatively rare compared to the central and southern parts of he range.

        -   especially populations occupying atypical habitat (streams, ephemeral ponds, shallow lake)

    -   Mossy Pond is one such population

        -   In the TNF, managed largely by CDFW (?)

        -   other relevant descriptions

    -   Mossy Pond population is a candidate donor population for areas identified as Native Species Reserves for SNYLF

-   Study Overview

    -   in 2014, CDFW began a 5-year CMR study to gain insight into this population because of its conservation significance

        -   get some of the "original directive" from Sara M & Isaac

    -   This paper describes analysis of the resulting data and establishes a relationship between (local climate variables and SNYLF population viability).
